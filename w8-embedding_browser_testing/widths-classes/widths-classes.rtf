\f0\fs36 \cf0 So let\'92s use this as a way to talk about how to make things larger and smaller within our pages, and to build some hierarchy among different items in the page. We\'92ll talk about how to use classes to distinguish certain types of items from one another. \
\
1) remove background color, make photos full width \
\
2) keep text at not-full width \
\
3) put in sidebar content, show how to distinguish that visually \
\
4) subheads centered (show how to center text but also use internal margin) \
\
So the first thing I\'92m going to do is to style up this text a little better, for viewing on the small screen. \
\

\b in the stylesheet: \

\b0 \
comment out the font color \
\
comment out body background color \
\
so now you can see we have the nav, but it\'92s not extending the full width of the page. How do we deal with that? \
\
Look in the inspector at how the nav is styled: remember that these items are 100% width, inside the container. So we could do a couple of different things to fix that: \
\
1) move nav outside container div; \
\
2) make margin: 0 on nav \
\
3) make nav 100vw \'97 using viewport width technique\
\
So none of these are working \'97 why is that? Let\'92s go inspect the body itself, and we see that the user agent stylesheet has added an 8px margin throughout. \
\
If we comment back in the body background, we can see that here visually: \
\
body\{\
  background-color:#ebe3ce;\
\}\
\
We can get rid of that like so: \
\
body\{\
  /*background-color:#ebe3ce;*/\
  margin: 0; \
\}\
\
although we\'92ll see that that also removes the extra margin we had on the body \'97 that is, the body text is still set to 95% margin but the extra 16px of margin we got rid of makes the overall body text wider. We can set that to 90% to get a little margin back. \
\
So looking down the page just slightly, we can see that our image is also inside the container div \'97 it\'92s also being constrained by the margin that\'92s there. Right now, if we look in the html, we can see that the image is set to be 100% width \'97 that\'92s being set by the container it\'92s in, that is, it\'92s 100% the width of its 90% width container. \
\
We can set the 100% width in the container, but if we do that, we get the same result. 100vw just takes it out to the edge of the page \'97 we still have 5% of the overall width on the left side. \
\
We could use a little hack of the viewport width technique to do something like this: \
\
      <img class="fullwidth" src="img/yoda.jpg" alt="A picture of Jedi Master Yoda"/>\
\
\
and \
\
.fullwidth \{\
  position: relative;\
  left: 50%;\
  transform: translate(-50%, 0);\
  width: 100vw;\
\}\
\
which can work for us \'97 any further image with a class of fullwidth will be the same size. Show this elsewhere: \
\
	<img class="fullwidth" src="img/luke.jpg" alt="A picture of Luke and Vader"/>\
\
Now it\'92s important to remember that this will make things full width by translating them over then using the vw tool to make them move. }
